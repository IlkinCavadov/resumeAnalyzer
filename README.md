Technologies: Python, Streamlit, pdfplumber, python-docx, spaCy, NLTK, SentenceTransformers, scikit-learn

Built an NLP-powered application that parses resumes (PDF/DOCX) and compares them against job descriptions.

Implemented text extraction using pdfplumber and python-docx.

Applied NLP preprocessing with spaCy and NLTK for tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal.

Used SentenceTransformers (BERT embeddings) to generate vector representations of resumes and job descriptions.

Calculated cosine similarity (scikit-learn) to score match percentage between candidate and job requirements.

Developed an interactive UI with Streamlit for uploading resumes and pasting job descriptions.

Provided structured outputs: overall match score, missing skills, and keyword analysis.
